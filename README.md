# Neovim Configuration

![Nvim Screenshot](./nvim-screenshot.png)

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration.

## Keybindings

The configuration uses the [WhichKey](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) plugin for keybinding management.
The `<leader>` key is mapped to `Space`.

## Installation

To use this configuration, clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d7omdev/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Then, open Neovim and let the magic Happen!.

```bash
nvim
```

Enjoy your Neovim experience!
